            <p class="space-after">Objective: The purpose of this project was for the students to build a truss bridge and test it to failure, and to analyze the results and compare them to their theoretical predictions. The truss bridge was required to span 300mm and could be built using no more than 40 popsicle sticks.</p>
            <p class="space-after">Design: Knowing that wood is stronger under compression than tension, I chose to build a Howe truss. In a Howe truss, the diagonals of the truss are in compression, while the vertical beams are in tension. I cut the popsicle sticks so that they fit together, creating stronger joints. I also reinforced many of the joints with extra popsicle stick pieces. This increased the strength of the members by decreasing the length of the sinusoidal bending wave. I performed force calculations on each member of the truss using the method of joints (see Appendix A), and then used those forces to calculate the capacity of each member (see Appendix B). After performing the capacity calculations, I thickened the weakest members with extra popsicle sticks and did the calculations again.</p>
            <p class="space-after">Results: My bridge held 311 N (70 lbs), which was 567 times its weight. The predicted capacity of the truss was 406 N. This showed that the method used to analyze the truss had some limitations. For example, it didn't take into account the lateral motion that the bridge experienced. It also didn't account for bending or the strength of the glue joints. During this lab, we learned that simple force calculations made using the method of joints were not enough to accurately predict the trusses behavior and that other factors must be considered.</p>
