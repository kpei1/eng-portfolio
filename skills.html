            <p class="skill-p">Experience: I was the lead 3D modeler on my high school robotics team. I taught a class on using PTC Creo at both the 2017 and 2018 FTC Kickoffs. I continue to use CAD when working on engineering projects at Hopkins.</p>
            <h3>3D Printing</h3>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: I have a 3D printer at my house which I use for my engineering projects, so I have a lot of experience with 3D printing. I taught a class on 3D printing at the 2018 FTC kickoff and have also done a lot of 3D printing in robotics.</p>
            <h3>Basic Machining Skills</h3>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: All mechanical engineering freshmen at Hopkins are required to be trained in the machine shop.</p>
