            <h3>Computer Aided Design</h3>
            <ul class="skill-ul">
                <li>PTC Creo</li>
                <li>Solidworks</li>
                <li>Ansys</li>
                <li>Blender</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: I was the lead 3D modeler on my high school robotics team. I taught a class on using PTC Creo at both the 2017 and 2018 FTC Kickoffs. I continue to use CAD when working on engineering projects at Hopkins.</p>
            <h3>3D Printing</h3>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: I have a 3D printer at my house which I use for my engineering projects, so I have a lot of experience with 3D printing. I taught a class on 3D printing at the 2018 FTC kickoff and did the majority of the 3D printing for my high school robotics team. This past summer, I was given a grant by the Johns Hopkins Life Design Lab to work on a personal 3D printing project, where I have been designing and 3D printing shoes. Through this project, I have gained experience printing with TPU as well as additional experience printing with PLA. Photos and updates on that project can be seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ballenaofficial/">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Basic Machining Skills</h3>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: All mechanical engineering freshmen at Hopkins are required to be trained in the machine shop.</p>
            <h3>Microsoft Office</h3>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: I have done the majority of my work since elementary school using Microsoft Office.</p>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <ul class="skill-ul">
                <li>MATLAB</li>
                <li>Java</li>

                <li>Basic web design</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="skill-p">Experience: I have taken courses through Hopkins and earned certificates online, which can be seen on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharinepriu/">LinkedIn page</a>. Some of my independent programming projects can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/kpei1">here</a>.</p>
