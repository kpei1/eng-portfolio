            <p class="space-after">Objective: The purpose of this project was to design a crane that could lift a 10 lb weight to a height of 1 inch above the floor within a 2 minute time limit. The boom of the crane was not allowed to deflect more than 0.5 inches, and the crane could not use more than $50 worth of parts, which all had to be purchased from McMaster-Carr.</p>
            <p class="space-after">Design: Since we were limited by the motor torque, we chose a gear train for our transmission system. The gear train allowed for a greater torque to be produced. We chose a boom with a larger height than width to increase the moment of inertia, which reduced the deflection. We also attached the boom to the baseplate in two places to reduce the deflection. When choosing the material for the boom, we had to look at the material properties and the dimensions to prevent the deflection from exceeding 0.5 in. To quickly test each boom we were considering, we wrote a MATLAB program where we could input new dimensions and material properties and output the maximum deflection.</p>
            <p class="space-after">Additional Notes: Due to the pandemic, we were unable to physically build and test our crane. However, we still calculated and used design factors appropriate for our design to theoretically achieve the desired results.</p>
