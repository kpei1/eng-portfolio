            <p class="space-after">Objective: The purpose of this project was to design a crane that could lift a 10 lb weight to a height of 1 inch above the floor within a 2 minute time limit. The boom of the crane was not allowed to deflect more than 0.5 inches, and the crane could not use more than $50 worth of parts, which all had to be purchased from McMaster-Carr.</p>
            <p class="space-after">Design: Since we were limited by the motor torque, we chose a gear train for our transmission system.</p>
