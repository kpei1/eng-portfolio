            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I worked on this robot with my high schoolâ€™s First Tech Challenge (FTC) team. The main
objective for the 2015-2016 year was to build a robot that could climb a steep, ladder-like ramp
and then hang from an upper set of bars by the end of the challenge. We designed our wheels to
be able to grab and climb the rungs of the ramp. I was a member of the build team that assembled
the robot. This was my first year on the robotics team, and I learned many important skills such
as CAD and basic robot design. I also learned how to clearly document the design process in an
engineering notebook. Our robot qualified for the state competition, and we were awarded a
patent for our wheel design.</p>
