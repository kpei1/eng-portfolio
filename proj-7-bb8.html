            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Over the summer, I designed and built a robot modeled after BB-8, a droid from the Star Wars
movie series. I used what I learned throughout my freshman year at Hopkins to set up and
program the robot’s electronics with Arduino. BB-8 is controlled using Bluetooth to connect to
the Android app Arduino Bluetooth RC Car. I 3D modeled BB-8’s body using PTC Creo and
                printed it on my Prusa MK2S 3D printer.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>To attach BB-8's head, I used neodymium magnets. I mounted one magnet to a post inside BB-8's body (see photo above) and glued another to the underside of his head. The magnets were powerful enough to remain attached through the ball during testing, as can be seen in the video below.</p>
