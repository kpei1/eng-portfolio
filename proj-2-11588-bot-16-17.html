            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The 2016-2017 FTC challenge was to design and build a robot that could collect and shoot small balls into a hoop, press buttons of the correct color autonomously, and lift a large exercise ball into the hoop. I worked primarily on the design and assembly of the body, especially on the extendable arms and drive mechanism that lifted the exercise ball. I modeled all the lexan components with 3D CAD software and fabricated them using a ShopBot CNC machine. Our robot qualified for the state competition, where we won the Motivate Award.</p>
