            <p class="space-after">Objective: To design and 3D print comfortable and stylish shoes that are custom-sized to each individual user's foot.</p>
            <p class="space-after">Design: I printed prototypes over the summer, which I tested for strength, comfort, flexibility, and stability. First I worked on creating a shoe that was the proper shape, and after a few prints, I created a sole that fit perfectly with my foot. Next I experimented with various infills to reduce the required material, while maintaining the stability of the shoe. However, I realized that the material I have been printing with is susceptible to torque, which could lead to my customers rolling their ankles. I am currently working on finding a way to make the shoes stable in the x-y plane, but flexible in the y-z plane so they can move comfortably with the foot. Once I have created a shoe that is safe to walk in, I plan to develop a sizing process that will allow me to easily adapt my model based on user-made measurements.</p>
