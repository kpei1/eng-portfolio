                <p class="space-after">Objective: To design and 3D print comfortable and stylish shoes that are custom-sized to each individual user's foot.</p>
                <p class="space-after">Constraints: Must print within the limits of a Prusa MK2S printer, and $300 budget obtained from JHU's Life Design Lab's <i>Design Your Summer Experience</i> grant.</p>
                <p class="space-after">Materials used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TPU - flexible; used for the body of the shoe so it will move with the user's foot</li>
                    <li>PLA - stiff; used for the heel of the shoe to provide adequate support</li>
                    <li>PVA - soluble; used in trial runs as a support material, but stopped using because the single nozzle was not able to adequately purge before changing materials; led to parts peeling between layers</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="space-after">Initial design: I printed prototypes over the summer, which I tested for strength, comfort, flexibility, and stability. First I worked on creating a shoe that was the proper shape, and after a few prints, I created a sole that fit perfectly with my foot. Next I experimented with various infills to reduce the required material, while maintaining the stability of the shoe. However, I realized that TPU is susceptible to torque, which could lead to my customers rolling their ankles. I am currently working on finding a way to make the shoes stable in the x-y plane, but flexible in the y-z plane so they can move comfortably with the foot. Once I have created a shoe that is safe to walk in, I plan to develop a sizing process that will allow me to easily adapt my model based on user-made measurements.</p>

                <p class="space-after">Updated design - PLA plate: After looking at professionally-made heels, I realized that the sloped arch of the shoe is often made of very stiff material, which led me to believe that I may not need to have the shoe made entirely of TPU to still be comfortable to move in. As long as the ball of the user's foot can roll comfortably along the ground, the back half of the shoe does not need to be as flexible. Therefore, to solve my issues with side-to-side torque, I have created a new model that contains a stiff PLA plate to prevent the shoe from twisting. This print requires a dual-nozzle printer to print both PLA and TPU at the same time. I am currently working with JHU's Makerspace to print this prototype.</p>

                <p class="space-after">Lessons learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Printing with TPU: must print at slow speeds, requires filament drying to prevent clogs</li>
                    <li>Printing with PVA: strings of PVA deposited into the part as the nozzle travels can compromise the layer adhesion</li>
                    <li>Printer troubleshooting: cold pulls, disabling the hotend</li>
