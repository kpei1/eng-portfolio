            <div class="img-w-p">
                <p class="p-img-width">&emsp;&emsp;I played the flute and the piccolo in the Cardinal Gibbons High School pep band. In pep band, most musicians had music books that attached directly to their instrument. For flute, however, the music book was attached to the musicianâ€™s arm and held in place with a tight elastic band. My fellow flute players and I found this very uncomfortable, so I decided to come up with a solution. I designed, 3D modeled, and 3D printed a lyre and music book that could attach directly to the instrument itself. They were easy to attach, light weight, and adjustable. I made flute lyres for the entire flute section, as well as one for piccolo.</p>
