                <p class="p-img-width" id="space-above">The objective of this project was to build a device that used the rotational energy from a falling 5 lb mass to rotate a spindle and launch a glider. My teamâ€™s design was inspired by the launch catapults on an aircraft carrier. We attached a dowel to the spindle, and as the spindle rotated, the dowel wound a string that was attached to a hook at the base of the runway. The nose of the plane sat on the hook, and as the string wound around the dowel, the plane was pulled up the runway and launched when the forward motion of the hook was stopped by a block of wood. Our glider launched at a speed of 17.5 ft/s and reached a height of 6 ft. The key lesson from this project involved frictional energy loss and how to mitigate it.</p>
