                <h3>Objective/Constraints</h3>
                <p class="space-after">Build a device that used the rotational energy from a falling 5 lb mass to rotate a spindle and launch a glider with a budget of $50. The glider had to actually glide, and was not allowed to be considered a projectile.</p>

            <div class="subbody">
                <h3>Initial Designs</h3>
                <p class="space-after">Glider prototype: When we began brainstorming ideas for the glider, we were all much more familiar with airplanes, so our first glider design looked quite a bit like a simple airplane. We quickly realized that we would need to adjust our design for a glider, though; the airplane design did not glide much at all, and was considered closer to a projectile. Because airplanes are made to fly well with engines, instead of gliding, this design did not work well for this project. We had also made our glider out of foamcore, which was heavy and cumbersome. We then began researching gliders, and chose a slim design using balsa wood.</p>
                <p class="space-after">Launcher prototype: Our initial launcher had a crossbow-type design. I did archery for many years, so I am familiar with how a bow works. As shown in the image below, as the spindle rotated, a hook would be reeled in, pulling back on the bow string. Once the hook hit a stopper, it would release, launching the glider. However, we did not have the proper materials to create this design safely. We used laser-cut acrylic to make our hook, and the force required to pull back on the string exceeding the hook's capabilities, and the hook shattered during launch. We were also having a difficult time getting the hook to hit the stopper at just the right angle to cause it to release, so we decided to rethink our idea. As we did more research, we learned the planes are often launched from aircraft carriers and decided to emulate that system.</p>

                <h3>Final Design</h3>
                <p class="space-after">My teamâ€™s final design was inspired by the launch catapults on an aircraft carrier. We attached a dowel to the spindle, and as the spindle rotated, the dowel wound a string that was attached to a hook at the base of the runway. The nose of the plane sat on the hook, and as the string wound around the dowel, the plane was pulled up the runway and launched when the forward motion of the hook was stopped by a block of wood. Our glider launched at a speed of 17.5 ft/s and reached a height of 6 ft. The key lesson from this project involved frictional energy loss and how to mitigate it.</p>

                <h3>Calculations</h3>
                <p class="space-after">We chose a launch angle of 45 degrees since this is the angle required to maximize the distance the glider travels. To pass over the string, which is 13 feet horizontally and 7 feet vertically from the launch site, we calculated the required initial velocity of the glider to be 30.02 ft/s using linear motion equations.</p>
                <p class="space-after">Once we knew the launch velocity, we were able to calculate the required radius of our wheel to reach this launch velocity. We assumed that friction was negligible, so the linear velocity at the surface of the wheel as it rotated and wound the string would be equal to the velocity of the glider, which was attached to that same string. We calculated the required wheel radius to be 0.6 inches. The maximum possible wheel radius was 3.5 inches, constrained by the position of the wheel with respect to the floor. We chose to make our wheel 2 inches in diameter, incorporating a safety factor of ~3.3. Based on the results of this project (the glider only reached ~58% of its expected speed), we can conclude that our assumption of negligble friction was invalid.</p>
