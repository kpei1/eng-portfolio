                <p>&emsp;&emsp;I was the team’s lead 3D modeler during the 2017-2018 season. The primary challenge for this season was to build a robot that could insert foam blocks into a vertical grid in a specific order. I was in charge of creating 3D models of the robot throughout the design process using PTC Creo, as well as teaching CAD to new students. I was also part of the drive team that controlled the robot during competition. Before the state competition, I created a VR simulation of our robot using the Unity Real-Time Development Platform in which the viewer could walk around on the competition field and view our robot from different angles. Due to my extensive experience with robot assembly, I was also a senior member of the build team, where I helped assemble the robot’s body and arm. In an earlier stage of our robot, we used a conveyor belt to lift foam blocks, and I designed and printed custom rollers for the conveyor belt. Our robot won the Inspire Award at the state qualifier and the Judges Award at the state championship.</p>
