                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p class="space-after">The residents at a local retirement community like to sail remote controlled sailboats on a lake nearby. However, algae tends to accumulate on the surface of the lake. The purpose of this project was to design a sailboat that can patrol the lake autonomously to keep it free of algae.</p>
                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>$50 budget</li>
                    <li>Must be completed by the end of the semester</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Initial Prototyping</h3>
                <p class="space-after">We initially used an RC transceiver to transmit user input from a handheld control board to the boat itself. However, the SoftwareSerial objects needed for the GPS and the RC transceiver interferred with each other, so we needed to find a different way to navigate on the lake. I had previous experience working with Bluetooth from my BB8 project, so we decided that would be a simple solution. It only used 1 Arduino Uno, and the user could connect to the boat using their phone.</p>
                <h3>Final Design</h3>
                <p class="space-after">We used an Arduino Uno to control the electronics on the boat. We had a hobby servo motor to control the rudder for steering, and a brushless DC motor to drive the boat. We controlled the DC motor using an Electronic Speed Control. We had an HM10 bluetooth module connected to the Arduino that allows the boat to be controlled using the ArduinoBlue app on an iPhone. Our boat had 3 states: idle mode, RC mode, and autonomous mode. In idle mode, the boat sits still and floats on the lake. In RC mode, the user can control the boat using the joystick on the iPhone. In autonomous mode, the boat patrols the lake much like a roomba; it has an infrared sensor at the front that can see when it is approaching the edge of the lake, at which point it turns around and goes in a different direction. The user can easily switch modes using pre-programmed buttons on their iPhone.</p>
