            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The objective of the design project was to create a
heat engine that uses the heat energy available in two
cups of boiling water to raise eight US quarters a
vertical distance of two inches. We each worked with
one other student to design and build our heat
engine.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;My team decided to use thermoelectric plates in
order to generate voltage to power a motor. Since
thermoelectric plates generate voltage when they
experience a large temperature difference between
their two sides, we sandwiched the plates between a
container of ice and a metal sheet placed over the pot
of boiling water. We then connected the plates to a
motor, which rotated a spindle to lift the quarters.
The system was able to lift the quarters in less than
two seconds.</p>
